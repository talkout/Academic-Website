## Building a Digital Control System

The expected outcome of this group project is building a closed-loop control system using an Arduino Uno as the base hardware for the controller.

### Project Scope:
The selection of a particular project should be bound by available resources and time.

### Resources:
The list of available tools as listed in this [parts list](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DcfyY0i6zOWGFRepfzSvQzuEUt4NVLFL/view?usp=sharing). If you require any additional components, you will have to discuss that with the lecturer.

## Project Groups
You may check of this page and verify [your group selections](). If your index number is listed with a "No Group" that means you did not provide your index number with you name lists or you did not send a group selection at all. If you are not assigned a group, please contact me immediately via nimal@sjp.ac.lk.

## Preliminary Project Proposal
You are required to submit a preliminary project proposal to screen for suitability of the project against the course requirements. You are advised to adhere to the format below:

 - Project Title
 - List of students in the groups
 - Description of the build (explain how it is a closed-loop control system in 1-2 paragraphs)
 - Any additional requirements
 
An assignment has been posted for the [submission of Preliminary Project Proposals](http://lms.tech.sjp.ac.lk/mod/assign/view.php?id=165). One member can submit on-behalf of the group. Please pay attention to the above guidelines and if there are any concerns raise them asap.

### Deadline for Preliminary Project Proposal:
Before next practical class. We will be discussing each proposal with the group at the next practical class.
